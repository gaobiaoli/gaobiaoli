## ðŸ›  Core Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

### 1. [**vUtils**](https://github.com/gaobiaoli/vUtils) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

[**vUtils**](https://github.com/gaobiaoli/vUtils) is a custom-built library actively developed by the author, aiming to standardize code modules for various aspects of digital twin technology in construction scenarios. This library plays a crucial role in the author's research projects, where it is extensively used and continuously updated with new features and improvements.

#### Key Features:
- **Multithreaded VideoCapture**: Accelerated video capture using multithreading for improved performance.
- **VideoCapture with Stabilization**: A specialized video capture module designed to remove camera shake in surveillance footage.
- **Post-Processing for Semantic Segmentation**: Tools for handling and refining the results of semantic segmentation models.

The author is committed to enhancing the functionality of **vUtils** to better support construction-related digital twin applications, with a strong focus on expanding its capabilities and optimizing performance.

### 2. [**Concrete Pouring Monitoring**](https://github.com/gaobiaoli/Sample_CPM_Concrete) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
- **Description**: This repository contains the sample code for my research paper: **Semantic segmentation-based framework for concrete pouring progress monitoring by using multiple surveillance cameras**(DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dibe.2023.100283).
- **Key Technologies**: Semantic Segmentation, Multiple Surveillance, Data Fusion, CRFs.

### 3. [**CLIP-Adapter**](https://github.com/gaobiaoli/ClipAdapter) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
